"""
The Hack assembler reads as input a text file named Prog.asm, containing a Hack
assembly program, and produces as output a text file named Prog.hack, containing
the translated Hack machine code. The name of the input file is supplied to the
assembler as a command line argument:

prompt> Assembler Prog.asm

The translation of each individual assembly command to its equivalent binary instruction
is direct and one-to-one. Each command is translated separately. In particular,
each mnemonic component (field) of the assembly command is translated into
its corresponding bit code according to the tables in section 6.2.2, and each symbol in
the command is resolved to its numeric address as specified in section 6.2.3.
We propose an assembler implementation based on four modules: a Parser module that parses the input,
a Code module that provides the binary codes of all the assembly mnemonics,
a SymbolTable module that handles symbols,
and a main program that drives the entire translation process.
