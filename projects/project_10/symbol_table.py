'''
A symbol table that associates names with information needed for Jack compilation: type, kind, and
running index. The symbol table has 2 nested scopes (class/subroutine).

        Starts a new subroutine scope (i.e. erases all names in the previous subroutineâ€™s scope.)

        '''
        Defines a new identifier of a given name, type, and kind and assigns it a running
